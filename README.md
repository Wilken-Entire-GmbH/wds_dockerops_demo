# P5 DMS: Docker based operation scenarios

P5 DMS: container based configuration examples

## Getting started

This repository describes the configuration of the **P5 Document Management** in a container-based scenario and the idea of how the **P5 DMS Services** work together using the **Retrieval** and **P52 Connector** service.

Beyond the specific examples, the configurations are transferable to most other ** P5 services **.
